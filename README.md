# MNIST-image-classifier
The purpose of this project is to experiment on machine learning models tasked to determine the maximum of 3 handwritten digits on given images. A gray-scale threshold was set to ﬁlter out most of the noise in the image, and after randomly applying small aﬃne transformations, the data was given to the models for predictions. Preexisting image classiﬁcation models and our adaptations were experimented on through this project, since simple models consisting of only a couple convolution layers resulted in very low accuracy. The models in question are VGG16 and ResNet. VGG16 ended up with more than 98 percent accuracy while ResNet only achieved 97 accuracy
